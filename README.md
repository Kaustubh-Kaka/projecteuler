# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems.

### Number of solutions available currently : 87

## Todo
* Add support for benchmarking the solutions

## To optimize

* **77** Euler's pentagonal number theorem
* **351** More efficient computation of (sum)phi(n), (Read doc)
* **96** (hyperoptimise i/o, share possible solution data across recursion calls, 3d vector)
* **719** (remove recursion, 1.5billion function calls :skull)
* **265** Too slow, optimise using euler tour
* **285** Solved using desmos, write code(maybe python)
* **213** Don't overuse lambdas, too much copying

## Updates
**[2025/10/16]** I have decided to write short text comments in the code explaining my thought process, I might do that for older solutions too but considering the effort required it's unlikely in the near future. I've also somewhat learnt how to write markdown files so hopefully the readmes are more legible now. I have removed header includes in all solutions and replaced them with `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` this makes the code compiler dependent but I believe readability is far more important.
