# projecteuler

My solutions to projecteuler 1-100 + (bonuses I have to remove/password restrict)

Files created but probems not solved : 8, 11, 29, 80

To optimize :
77
(can be done in O(n), similar technique in 78), note from future : I am dumb, to the best of my knowledge O(n^2) is the best possible solution, solved it but took 8s (:sad), nvm, O(n) solution does exist using binomial coeffients, use star delta to compute the number of ways to split n into k parts and sum this over k in 1..n(is there a closed from?), but this solution needs double/bigint
96
(hyperoptimise i/o, share possible solution data across recursion calls)
719
(remove recursion, 1.5billion function calls :skull)

Number of solutions available currently : 43
